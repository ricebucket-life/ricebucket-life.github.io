## Homelab Philosophy

This site will mostly be used to document my homelab as I will be using it as my career portfolio.

I need to continuously learn new technologies and in order for me to be up-to-date on the latest technological trends, I need a way to implement a hands-on practice to understand how these technologies work. I'll be using my homelab as my career portfolio, along with this site to jot down my process and thoughts. Hopefully, this will also improve my technical writing so I can be more clear in explaining my reasons.

I am also a stock market ~~gambler~~ trader, so maybe I can use this site to journal my trades.

I am also an Amaetur Mobile Photographer, so maybe I can use this site to post some of my photos that are good in MY PERSONAL opinion.

## Why Github pages?

No DB backend. No complex frontend with lots of javascripts. Static pages is the way to go for performance, security, and ease of use.
